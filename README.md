# SpaceSHMUP
One of the projects I worked on for my 3D Game Dev Class. We worked on this project for about 5 weeks (roughly 1 month). It was created using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition and Unity Hub. It also utilizes the coding language of C#. It is meant to have aspects to that of [Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga), [Galaxian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxian), and [Ikaruga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikaruga). We also used this [textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Game-Design-Prototyping-Development/dp/0134659864) for aspects of the code and assets. If you are curious about the various prefabs & assets that I have used in my project be sure to check out the [License.txt](https://github.com/Juniperistic/SpaceSHMUP/blob/main/License.txt) for all of that information. Unfortunately due to copyright & things of that nature, I am unsure if I am able to upload the prefabs that I have created from these assets directly onto this repo.
